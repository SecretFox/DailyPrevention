# DailyPrevention
Prevents your alts from stealing your daily  cache keys, event rewards should still be claimable on all characters(can't test until next event).  
If you want to claim daily reward on your alt you have to be holding ctrl while clicking the claim button.  
Install as normal and fill your main characters name into LoginPrefs.xml file, you can use comma separated list too(in case you use multiple accounts on same PC).  

**Installation**  
Unzip to ..\Secret World Legends\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\ folder.
